Tutorial:

1. First open the settings to Webstorm and connect the git.exe file to version control and test it.
2. Create a new project and name it then add files and make changes to any of them.
3. Go into the VCS tab and click create git repository from import into version control to create a local repository. This allows for git commands to work on the directory, so if you were using the Git shell then commands such as git commit -m "message" would work.
4. Click either commit in the VCS tab or the checkmark in the top right corner of Webstorm.
5. When commiting add a comment to help keep track of the changes you have made for that instance.
6. Enter your Github credentials and then press share project on github in webstorm from the import into tab.
7. Check your Github account to see if the repository has been created on the site and matches yours.
8. To make any subsequent changes you will need to commit and then push to the remote repository on Github.
